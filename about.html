                <p>Peace with nature means that human relations with other beings are controlled constitutionally within a community to which not only mankind belongs. <br>constitutionally
                    restricted and in this sense non-violent, human domination is legitimate.<br> What we are allowed to do depends on who we are. Mankind is the species in which nature emerges
                    to express herself in language, art and reason, and in doing so she moves herself forward with us.<br> How we should realte ourselves to nature also depends 
                    on our understanding of nature.

                    <br>
                    Nature basically is acting nature, or creative power, and in this sense equally is the nature of the beings of nature.<br>
                    Some artifacts are more natural and correspond to peace with nature better than others which are unnatural and violate peace with nature.<br> Also 
                    in our fellow world, and even apart from man's influence, nature is whatought to be.<br>  The technological less advanced countries should not repeat
                    the mistakes of the industrialized countries. <br>The traditional pattern of industrial economy can not be generalized to all peoples and violates
                    peace with nature. Plants are not only most sensitive indicators to environmental pollution but to the loss humanity as well.

                    Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops. Let the rain sing you a lullaby
